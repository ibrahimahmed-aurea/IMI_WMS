This registry file contain optional settings regarding the date and time format.

In some situations there is a problem on the RF-server with its Regional Settings
continously changing. To make the RF-clients use a specific date format install
this reg-file on the RF-server by doubleclicking it. You may alter the settings in
the file before you install it or you may open the Registry Editor, locate the key
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Aptean\IMI Warehouse\7.1\NLS]
and change the values. The values are

- DecimalSeparator,  this is either , or .
- DateSeparator, this is usually / or -
- ShortDateFormat, the format (order of day, month and year), for example yyyy-mm-dd or d/m/yyyy.
- TimeSeparator, this is either : or .
- TimeAMString, nothing or am
- TimePMString, nothing or pm
- ShortTimeFormat, the format without seconds, for example hh:mm
- LongTimeFormat, the format with seconds, for example hh:mm:ss

Note that the DateSeparator is the separator that is used, the ShortDateFormat only describes the
order of the day, month and year NOT the separator, the same is for the time formats.

If these settings are missing in the registry, Windows settings are used instead.

To unistall this, simply remove these entire NLS-key from the registry.
