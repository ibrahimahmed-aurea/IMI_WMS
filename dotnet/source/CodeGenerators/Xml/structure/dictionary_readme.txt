When changing the interface the corresponding dictionary file must
be updated.

If a new field is added then a correct "CamelCase" entry for that
field must be present in the WMSDictionary.xml or RMSDictionary.xml
(located in dotnet\source\CodeGenerators\Xml\structure).

This dictionary is used when autogeneration the webservice
interface.
