To test this do the following:

0. Synchronize the code to a local sandbox, i.e. this might not run well in a
   dynamic view. You might get security exceptions from the .NET runtime.

1. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.

2. Set the command line properties of the project i.e. in file and outfile.
   NOTE! There is a sample in file in the sample directory.

3. Check the outfile for the results.
